# SkClone
## A project to build Machine Learning models from scratch in python
## Author: Suprabhat Rijal
### Overview:
SkClone is a project to build a machine learning library that is able to solve ML problems like regression and classification. It is structured similarly to a popular open-source ML library "**SkLearn**",  hence the name "**SkClone**". At this point, this is just a hobby project to figure out how various machine learning models work. 
### Next Few Milestones:
1) Implement the "**K-Means++**" algorithm to properly initialize the centroids in my implementation of the **K-Means** algorithm
2) Write "**setup.py**" so that people can download the package using pip.
### What I've implemented so far:
1) **Linear Regression:** This implementation utilizes gradient descent(not stochastic)  to locate the minima and updates the weight and bias to fit the line. An example of linear regression using SkClone is plotted below: <img src="C:\Users\goodg\PycharmProjects\SkClone\Assets\LinearRegression.png"/> 
2) **K-Nearest-Neighbors Classification:** This implementation simply finds a specified number(denoted by "K") of closest datapoints(Neighbors) and holds a majority vote between them in orders to classify new datapoints. An example of K-Nearest-Neighbors classification using SkClone is plotted below:<img src="C:\Users\goodg\PycharmProjects\SkClone\Assets\KNN.png"/> 
3)  **K-Means Classification:**
